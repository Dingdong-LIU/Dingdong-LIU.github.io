My name is Dingdong LIU. I'm currently a PhD candidate in department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the [HCI Initiative](https://hci.cse.ust.hk/) of [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Xiaojuan, MA](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/xiaojuan-ma) and Prof. [Fugee, TSUNG](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/fugee-tsung) since 2022. I also do research on humanoid robot with Prof. [Bertram Emil SHI](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/bertram-emil-shi) in [Center for Aging Science](https://aging.hkust.edu.hk/). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Data Science at HKUST.

My research interest lies in robotics and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a focus on exploring interaction mode between human and AI agents (chatbots, physical robots, etc.). I aim to gain insights into the capabilities that an agent should have to better support human in various tasks, including daily task planning and decision making, medical services, etc.
