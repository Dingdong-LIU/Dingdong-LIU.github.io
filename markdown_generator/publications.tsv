13/6/2024	Exploring the Effects of Self-Mockery to Improve Task-Oriented Chatbot's Social Intelligence	DIS' 22	"This study explores the impact of self-mockery humor on a customer service chatbot's Social Intelligence (SI) by proposing a pipeline for incorporating situated self-mockery in different interaction stages. Through a within-subject experiment involving 28 participants, the self-mockery chatbot was found to be significantly funnier, more satisfactory, and to perform better in certain aspects of SI compared to a chatbot without self-mockery utterances. The study also discusses individual factors influencing the perceived helpfulness of self-mockery on SI and provides design considerations based on the findings."

22/11/2022	PlanHelper: Supporting Activity Plan Construction with Answer Posts in Community-based QA Platforms	CSCW '22	"This study addresses challenges in using answer posts from Community-based Question Answering (CQA) platforms for constructing Activity Plans (AP). By proposing an answer-post processing pipeline and developing PlanHelper, users were found to be significantly more satisfied with informational support and more engaged when creating AP compared to a Quora-like baseline in a within-subject study involving 24 participants. The research also includes an analysis of user behaviors with PlanHelper and provides design considerations for similar supporting tools."
