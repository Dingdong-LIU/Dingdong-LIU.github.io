13/6/2022	Exploring the Effects of Self-Mockery to Improve Task-Oriented Chatbot's Social Intelligence	DIS' 22	"This study explores the impact of self-mockery humor on a customer service chatbot's Social Intelligence (SI) by proposing a pipeline for incorporating situated self-mockery in different interaction stages. Through a within-subject experiment involving 28 participants, the self-mockery chatbot was found to be significantly funnier, more satisfactory, and to perform better in certain aspects of SI compared to a chatbot without self-mockery utterances. The study also discusses individual factors influencing the perceived helpfulness of self-mockery on SI and provides design considerations based on the findings."

22/11/2022	PlanHelper: Supporting Activity Plan Construction with Answer Posts in Community-based QA Platforms	CSCW '22	"This study addresses challenges in using answer posts from Community-based Question Answering (CQA) platforms for constructing Activity Plans (AP). By proposing an answer-post processing pipeline and developing PlanHelper, users were found to be significantly more satisfied with informational support and more engaged when creating AP compared to a Quora-like baseline in a within-subject study involving 24 participants. The research also includes an analysis of user behaviors with PlanHelper and provides design considerations for similar supporting tools."

16/7/2024	A Humanoid Robot Dialogue System Architecture Targeting Patient Interview Tasks	ROMAN '24	"The project focuses on enhancing humanoid robots' performance in conducting patient interviews by developing a dialogue system architecture. Humanoid robots offer a unique advantage in utilizing verbal and behavioral cues during interviews. However, the human-like appearance can create expectations of human-level performance, leading to interaction quality degradation if not met. The project introduces a dialogue system architecture that includes a nested inner real-time control loop to enhance the robot's responsiveness based on the concept of ""stance."" This architecture also expands the dialogue state to monitor task progress and human engagement. Experiments with the proposed architecture demonstrate improved performance in terms of response timeliness and user impressions during patient interviews."

29/4/2025	InsightBridge: Enhancing Empathizing with Users through Real-Time Information Synthesis and Visual Communication	CHI' 25	"This project introduces InsightBridge, an AI-assisted tool that supports researchers during early-stage user interviews by automatically synthesizing conversation data into empathy maps. The system enables researchers to generate visual abstracts representing key information, which can be verified with users in real-time to refine understanding. Evaluation through a within-subject study (N=32) demonstrated that InsightBridge enhances note-taking efficiency, improves mutual understanding between researchers and users, and helps uncover overlooked details through visual-based verification discussions."

30/4/2025	Scaffolded Turns and Logical Conversations: Designing Humanized LLM-Powered Conversational Agents for Hospital Admission Interviews	CHI' 25	"This project develops a more humanized LLM-powered conversational agent for hospital admission interviews that addresses the challenges of nurse shortages and time constraints. The system implements clinician-derived communication strategies through dynamic topic management with graph-based conversation flows and context-aware scaffolding using few-shot prompt tuning. Technical evaluation showed performance comparable to or exceeding human-written ground truth while outperforming prompt-engineered baselines, and a between-subject study (N=44) demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and data collection accuracy compared to existing solutions. The work contributes a framework for translating clinician expertise into algorithmic strategies for medical conversational agents, along with insights for balancing efficiency and empathy in healthcare interactions."

26/8/2025	Dynamic Prompting Improves Turn-taking in Embodied Spoken Dialogue Systems	ROMAN' 25	"A humanoid-robot SDS improves turn-taking by dynamically adjusting prompts to an audio LLM based on real-time floor perception (who’s speaking/listening). The LLM’s output drives both speech and floor-state updates, letting the system signal its stance. In robot interviews, this dynamic prompting outperformed static prompts: more accurate floor transitions, better signaling, fewer interruptions, smoother dialogue"	"Yifan Shen, Dingdong Liu, Xiaoyu Mo, Fugee Tsung, Xiaojuan Ma, Bertram E.
