excerpt: 'This study explores the impact of self-mockery humor on a customer service chatbot&apos;s Social Intelligence (SI) by proposing a pipeline for incorporating situated self-mockery in different interaction stages. Through a within-subject experiment involving 28 participants, the self-mockery chatbot was found to be significantly funnier, more satisfactory, and to perform better in certain aspects of SI compared to a chatbot without self-mockery utterances. The study also discusses individual factors influencing the perceived helpfulness of self-mockery on SI and provides design considerations based on the findings.'
