title: "Dynamic Prompting Improves Turn-taking in Embodied Spoken Dialogue Systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/26/8/2025-ROMAN25-TurnTaking
excerpt: 'A humanoid-robot SDS improves turn-taking by dynamically adjusting prompts to an audio LLM based on real-time floor perception (who’s speaking/listening). The LLM’s output drives both speech and floor-state updates, letting the system signal its stance. In robot interviews, this dynamic prompting outperformed static prompts: more accurate floor transitions, better signaling, fewer interruptions, smoother dialogue'
