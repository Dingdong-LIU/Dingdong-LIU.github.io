title: "PlanHelper: Supporting Activity Plan Construction with Answer Posts in Community-based QA Platforms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/22/11/2022-CSCW22-PlanHelper
excerpt: 'This study addresses challenges in using answer posts from Community-based Question Answering (CQA) platforms for constructing Activity Plans (AP). By proposing an answer-post processing pipeline and developing PlanHelper, users were found to be significantly more satisfied with informational support and more engaged when creating AP compared to a Quora-like baseline in a within-subject study involving 24 participants. The research also includes an analysis of user behaviors with PlanHelper and provides design considerations for similar supporting tools.'
