title: "InsightBridge: Enhancing Empathizing with Users through Real-Time Information Synthesis and Visual Communication"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/29/4/2025-CHI25-InsightBridge
excerpt: 'This project introduces InsightBridge, an AI-assisted tool that supports researchers during early-stage user interviews by automatically synthesizing conversation data into empathy maps. The system enables researchers to generate visual abstracts representing key information, which can be verified with users in real-time to refine understanding. Evaluation through a within-subject study (N=32) demonstrated that InsightBridge enhances note-taking efficiency, improves mutual understanding between researchers and users, and helps uncover overlooked details through visual-based verification discussions.'
